# wordy
A improved version of the popular game called wordle. The original game basically requires for the player to guess a 5 letter word using 6 tries, while giving them clues as to which of the letters they guessed were correct and which were incorrect. 

Currently, wordle does most of the game logic on the frontend, which means that one can simply use the browser developer tools to find the word of the day. My aim is to improve on this design by doing much of the game logic on a backend server, which would the be used to obfuscate the actual word of the day.
