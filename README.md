# wordy
A improved version of the popular game called wordle. The original game basically requires for the player to guess a 5 letter word using 6 tries, while giving them clues as to which of the letters they guessed were correct and which were incorrect. Currently, wordle does most of the game logic on the frontend, which means that one can simply use the browser developer tools to find the word of the day. My aim is to solve this.
